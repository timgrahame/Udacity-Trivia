    Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank
    lines.

    Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank
    line.

    Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of
    related functions.  Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of
    related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

    Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical
    sections.
